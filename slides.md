  # The Human Factor in DevOps...
  ## Because Even ü§ñ Need Good Teammates (Almost)

  Remember when "DevOps" meant throwing code (and maybe a few passive-aggressive emails, that thankfully weren‚Äôt meetings) over the wall? We‚Äôd like to think that the last decade and a half has dispelled us of that notion, but has it really? Often when organizations begin their ‚ÄúDevOps Transformation‚Äù they focus so much on automation, but the component that is more often than not overlooked is the human element. Human connection.

  In this talk, Jeremy will dig into some strategies for building teams that actually work together, and might even come to like each other (though he can‚Äôt promise ‚Äúmeetings that are emails‚Äù will become a norm). He‚Äôll talk about ways to encourage open communication, resolve conflicts, and create a team culture where everyone feels valued - because even the best automation tools can‚Äôt replace a team that actually works together.

# The Human Factor in DevOps
## It starts with people...

<!--
I will say this now, and then I will say it again, that DevOps is not just about tools and automation - it all starts with people and how they work together. But that's not always an easy thing to do because - everyone look around you - often us humans suck. So I am going to first explore common breakdowns in communication and teamwork, and how we can work to overcome them. Then, I'll look at ways that AI/ML can help... and hurt... our teams.

# The Human Factor in DevOps
## Communication & Teamwork breakdowns

<!--
A multitude of factors can contribute to communication and teamwork breakdowns in the dynamic environment of software development. I'm sure everyone could come up with an example. Maybe you're sitting next to one right now... don't look, but blink twice if you can relate. What are some of the causes of communication breakdowns that you have seen (don't feel like you need to be specific)?

### Common Causes of _Communication_ Breakdowns

<v-clicks>

* Conflicting Ideas and Poor Collaboration
* Barriers to Cross-Cultural and Linguistic Communication
* Ineffective Organizational Structures and Communication Processes
* Ambiguous Project Requirements and Technical Miscommunication

</v-clicks>

<!--
A multitude of factors can contribute to communication and teamwork breakdowns in the dynamic environment of software development. Some of the most prevalent causes are: [click]**Conflicting Ideas and Poor Collaboration:** Diverse perspectives are common in software development, but unresolved conflicts can lead to confusion, hinder progress, and significantly reduce productivity. [click]**Barriers to Cross-Cultural and Linguistic Communication:**Globalized teams face challenges due to varying cultural backgrounds and language proficiencies, causing misunderstandings and errors. [click]**Ineffective Organizational Structures and Communication Processes:** Complex team hierarchies and inadequate communication tools or protocols contribute to information silos, delayed decisions, and reduced transparency. [click]**Ambiguous Project Requirements and Technical Miscommunication:** Unclear project requirements and miscommunication between developers (e.g., technical jargon, poor documentation) result in assumptions, rework, and increased development time.

### Common Causes of _Teamwork_ Breakdowns

<v-clicks>

* Lack of shared understanding and commitment
* Team size and dynamics

</v-clicks>

<!--
[click]**Lack of Shared Understanding and Commitment:** Teams struggle when members don't share a clear vision of project goals and individual responsibilities. This misalignment leads to confusion and hinders effective collaboration. [click]**Team Size and Dynamics:** In larger teams, individual effort often diminishes, leading to the "Ringelmann Effect" and decreased productivity. Who's heard of the Ringelmann Effect?

<span style="position: absolute; bottom: 10%; left: 25px; color: yellow; font-style: italic;">Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringelmann_effect">Wikipedia</a></span>

<!--
Maximilien Ringelmann was a French agricultural engineer in the late 19th Century. While studying the relationship between process loss (i.e., reductions in performance effectiveness or efficiency) and group productivity, he found that having group members work together on a task (e.g., pulling a rope) actually results in significantly less effort than when individual members are acting alone. Ringelmann discovered that as more and more people are added to a group, the group often becomes increasingly inefficient, ultimately violating the notion that group effort and team participation reliably leads to increased effort on behalf of the members.

### Common Causes of _Teamwork_ Breakdowns

* Lack of shared understanding and commitment
* Team size and dynamics

<v-clicks>

* Lack of trust
* Insuffient resources
* Unclear goals and expectations

</v-clicks>

<!--
This can also cause communication breakdowns and a general decline in team cohesion. [click]**Lack of Trust:** Without trust, team members hesitate to communicate openly and honestly. This inhibits problem-solving, stifles creativity, and can lead to unresolved conflicts. [click]**Insufficient Resources:** Teams require adequate resources, including time, budget, and tools, to complete tasks effectively. A lack of resources can lead to burnout, missed deadlines, and subpar results. [click]**Unclear Goals and Expectations:** When team members don't understand project objectives or their roles within the team, they struggle to prioritize tasks, make decisions, and work together effectively.

# The _Human_ Factor in DevOps
## Even ü§ñ's Can be a Good Teammate (Mostly)

<!--
As I stated earlier, I'm saying this again: DevOps is not just about tools and automation - it all starts with people and how they work together. We have to get that all functioning first before we throw some computer and some ML models in the form of a hipster SaaS company that promises that you'll never have another issue with communication again. Just like we don't throw an AI Agent at any data without first understanding the data, the problem we're trying to solve, and even if the data is correct, as well as the potential biases that could be introduced. So start there.
